# EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

In data mining, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA is used for seeing what the data can tell us before the modeling task. It is not easy to look at a column of numbers or a whole spreadsheet and determine important characteristics of the data. It may be tedious, boring, and/or overwhelming to derive insights by looking at plain numbers. Exploratory data analysis techniques have been devised as an aid in this situation.

Exploratory data analysis is generally cross-classified in two ways. First, each method is either non-graphical or graphical. And second, each method is either univariate or multivariate (usually just bivariate).
